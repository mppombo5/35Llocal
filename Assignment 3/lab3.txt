Verifying signature: the only problem is a warning that says the key is not
certified and that there's no indication that the signature belongs to
the owner.

Installing coreutils 8.29 with make:
Set the prefix by using ./configure --prefix=$(echo ~/coreutilsInstall)
make; make install

Use wget
"https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?att=1;
filename=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch;bug=30963;msg=10" to get the file,
renamed it to "patch_file" for ease of use.

Bug has been reproduced by changing directory into coreutilsInstall and typing
./ls -a -A

-pnum option in patch removes slashes from filenames found in the patch file,
so we can search for the filename between different systems.
Therefore, I find the filenames in the patch file and see how many slashes I
should remove.

Every file in lsAa.patch seems to be of the form a/{dir}, so I should remove
one slash.
So, I execute
patch -p1 < patch_file

src/ls.c, tests/local.mk, and test/ls/a-option.sh were successfully patched,
but NEWS failed to be patched.

After running "autoreconf -fi" within the coreutils-8.29 directory (thanks
Kedar), I ran "make" and ran the newly compiled ls on the src directory.

Commands run:

CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/sh /bin/sh ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/pombo/CI2
--no-create --no-recursion
    presumably this is to configure the prefix so it knows to install
coreutils to ~/coreutilsInstall.

/bin/sh ./config.status
    it seems like the most important function this command performs is
to create the Makefile. It also creates a few other config files for the
make project.

make all-recursive
    this is the command that actually compiles the binaries to be updated.

Sure enough, when I run ls -aA, the files . and .. are omitted as expected.
