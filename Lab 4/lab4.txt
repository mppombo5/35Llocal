Problems building as-is:
./configure --prefix=[dir] worked fine, but when I tried to run the make
command I got an error telling me that there were conflicting data types for
the function "futimens".

Reproducing the bug:
When I copied and ran the script on my machine, sure enough the wwi-armistice file said it was made in 2054.
